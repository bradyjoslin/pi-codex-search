**Search the web in Pi through your Codex subscription.**

Pi keeps the harness small. Codex already has a ChatGPT-backed search path. This package connects the two: it adds a `codex_search` tool to Pi and uses the same `openai-codex` login Pi already knows about.

No `ACCESS_TOKEN` env var. No separate login flow. If Pi can use your Codex subscription, this extension can use the same auth.

## Why this exists

Web search does not have to be built into Pi. It can be a tool.

This extension is for Pi workflows that need fresh or source-backed information:

- **Look up current docs and release notes.** Ask the model to check things that changed after its training cutoff.
- **Get sources with the answer.** Search results include citations when Codex returns them.
- **Reuse your Codex login.** The tool uses Pi's existing `openai-codex` OAuth credential instead of asking you to paste tokens.
- **Batch related searches in Responses mode.** One tool call can run related queries together. Standalone mode sends each action as its own Codex request because `/alpha/search` rejects multi-action batching.
- **Keep projects in control.** Rename the tool, change defaults, or disable it per project.

## What this package adds

- A `codex_search` Pi tool.
- 1–5 search queries per call in the default Responses API.
- Experimental standalone `/alpha/search` mode with search, image search, open, find, click, screenshot, finance, weather, sports, and time commands, sent serially as one action per backend request.
- `live`, `indexed`, or `cached` freshness, plus `low` / `medium` / `high` search context size. Standalone mode disables `low` because Codex returns Cloudflare challenges for low-context standalone requests.
- Streaming progress while Codex responds.
- Collapsed result previews in the TUI, with full text and sources available when expanded.
- Structured details: model, citations, search calls, response ids, usage, and per-query failures.
- Config files for home and project defaults.
- `/codex-search-settings` for status, editing, reset, rename, and disable.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-codex-search
```

Or load a local checkout without installing:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-codex-search
```

### Install from GitHub Release tarball

If you prefer not to use npm, download the tarball from the [latest release](https://github.com/Leechael/pi-codex-search/releases/latest), extract it, and install from the local path:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/Leechael/pi-codex-search/releases/latest/download/pi-codex-search.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
pi install /tmp/pi-codex-search
```

## Sign in

Inside Pi, run:

```text
/login openai-codex
```

Choose `ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex Subscription)` if Pi asks which provider to use. Pi stores and refreshes the credential.

The tool is registered by default. If Pi has no `openai-codex` token, or if the ChatGPT account id cannot be found from the stored OAuth credential or decoded access token, the first `codex_search` call fails with an `auth` error that points back to `/login openai-codex`.

Set `enabled: false` if you want the extension installed but hidden for a project.

## Tool

Default tool name:

```text
codex_search
```

Example call:

```json
{
  "name": "codex_search",
  "arguments": {
    "queries": ["latest OpenAI Codex release notes"],
    "search_context_size": "medium",
    "freshness": "live"
  }
}
```

Arguments in default `responses` mode:

- `queries` — required array of 1–5 search questions. Queries run in parallel and results are grouped by query.
- `search_context_size` — optional, one of `low`, `medium`, `high`; defaults to `medium`. In standalone mode, use `medium` or `high` only.
- `freshness` — optional, `live`, `indexed`, or `cached`; defaults to `live`.

Extra arguments in experimental `standalone` mode:

- `queries` — optional array of 1–4 search questions. Each query is sent serially as a separate standalone request.
- `urls` — pages to open/fetch directly.
- `find` — `{ "url", "pattern" }` objects for in-page text search.
- `click` — `{ "url", "id" }` objects for following link ids from an opened page.
- `screenshot` — `{ "url", "pageno" }` objects for page screenshots.
- `image_queries` — image search queries.
- `finance`, `weather`, `sports`, `time` — Codex web lookup commands.

The tool returns text. When citations are available, the text includes a `Sources:` section.

The structured `details` object includes:

- `model`
- `api`
- `freshness` / `searchContextSize`
- `queryCount` / `failedQueryCount`
- `successes`: per-query `{ query, text, citations, searchCalls, responseId?, usage? }`
- `failures`: per-query `{ query, kind, message }`

Failure `kind` is one of `auth`, `rate_limit`, `transport`, `timeout`, `schema`, or `unknown`.

## Model used for search

The search request needs a Codex model id. The extension chooses it in this order:

1. `model` from env / project / home config, if set.
2. The active Pi model, if it comes from the `openai-codex` provider.
3. The default model from Codex's `/codex/models` response.

Most users do not need to set this.

## Settings

Most users only need `/login openai-codex`. Use settings when you want to rename the tool, disable it for a project, pin a model, or change defaults.

Open the interactive settings dialog:

```text
/codex-search-settings
```

Useful subcommands:

```text
/codex-search-settings status
/codex-search-settings reset
```

Settings are merged from three layers, highest precedence first:

1. Environment variables.
2. Project file: `<cwd>/.pi/pi-codex-search.json`.
3. Home file: `~/.pi/pi-codex-search.json`.

Each layer is optional. Missing files are skipped. Malformed JSON or invalid values fail fast so you do not silently run with the wrong tool settings.

Because the project file lives under `<cwd>/.pi/`, it follows Pi's project trust rules. If you decline to trust a project, the extension reads only the home file and environment variables; the project scope is hidden in the settings dialog and cannot be saved or deleted until the project is trusted.

Full schema, all fields optional:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "toolName": "codex_search",
  "model": "gpt-5-codex",
  "baseUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api",
  "clientVersion": "1.0.0",
  "searchContextSize": "medium",
  "freshness": "live",
  "searchApi": "responses"
}
```

`enabled: false` skips tool registration entirely. The model will not see `codex_search` at all.

`toolName` lets you avoid conflicts with another extension. Tool names must match `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,63}`.

`searchApi` chooses the backend path. `responses` is the default and uses the `/codex/responses` hosted web-search flow. `standalone` is experimental: it posts web commands to `/codex/alpha/search` on `chatgpt.com/backend-api` or `/v1/alpha/search` for `api.openai.com/v1`-style bases, sends each search/web action serially as a separate request, stores returned ref ids for follow-up open/find/click/screenshot actions, disables `low` search context, and may be blocked by Cloudflare or backend session limits.

Environment variable equivalents:

| Field               | Env var                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`           | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED`        |
| `toolName`          | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_TOOL_NAME`      |
| `model`             | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_MODEL`          |
| `baseUrl`           | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL`       |
| `clientVersion`     | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_CLIENT_VERSION` |
| `searchContextSize` | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT_SIZE`   |
| `freshness`         | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_FRESHNESS`      |
| `searchApi`         | `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_API`            |

`PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED` accepts `true` / `false` (case-insensitive). Any other value fails config loading.

The settings dialog shows a unified `SettingsList` view. The model picker loads available Codex models asynchronously after the dialog opens, so the UI appears immediately even when `/codex/models` is slow. Interactive edits write the selected config file immediately. When you close the dialog, Pi reloads so the new tool name and defaults apply without restarting the whole terminal.

## Notes

### Codex search vs model search

This does not add browsing to the model provider itself. It adds a Pi tool. The model decides when to call `codex_search`, just like any other tool.

### Account id

Codex requests need both the access token and the ChatGPT account id. The extension first checks Pi's stored OAuth credential. If that does not include an account id, it tries to extract one from the access token.

## Troubleshooting

### `codex_search` fails with an `auth` error

Run:

```text
/login openai-codex
```

If Pi asks for a provider, choose `ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex Subscription)`. The extension picks up the refreshed credential on the next call.

### `codex_search` says the account id was not found

The stored OAuth credential did not include an account id, and the extension could not decode one from the access token. Re-run `/login openai-codex` so Pi refreshes the credential.

### The model does not see `codex_search`

Check whether `enabled` is false in env, project config, or home config:

```text
/codex-search-settings status
```

Remember that env overrides project, and project overrides home.

### Search uses the wrong model

Set `model` in your config file, or set `PI_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_MODEL`, to the Codex model id you want. If unset, the extension uses the active Codex model when possible, then falls back to the default model from `/codex/models`.

### A different extension already registers `codex_search`

Use `/codex-search-settings` to rename this extension's tool, or set `toolName` in `~/.pi/pi-codex-search.json`. Tool renames apply after the settings dialog reloads Pi.

## Development
